# Alex-Jones-Soundboard
An iOS app built in Swift that plays various Alex Jones soundbites.

============================================
# UPDATE – 11/29/2018

The laptop I was developing on has caught fire and I did not back anything up because I'm an idiot, meaning that my local copy of the source code is gone. Updates may be sporadic.

============================================

# WARNING

UI elements are NOT scaled yet! This means that the buttons will not be centered or take up the correct amount of the screen on the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8 Plus. Buttons will be partially cut off of the screen on the iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5S, or SE. The only iPhones that display the buttons well are the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, 8, and X. If you think you can fix it before I figure it out, send a pull request and I'll look over it. If you have an iPhone that does not have a 4.7 or 5.8 inch screen, you will need to fix it yourself within Xcode.
