# Alex-Jones-Soundboard
An iOS app built in Swift that plays various Alex Jones soundbites.


#WARNING

UI elements are NOT scaled yet! This means that the buttons will not be centered or take up the correct amount of the screen on the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8 Plus. Buttons will be partially cut off of the screen on the iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5S, or SE. The only iPhones that display the buttons well are the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, 8, and X. If you think you can fix it before I figure it out, send a pull request and I'll look over it. If you have an iPhone that does not have a 4.7 or 5.8 inch screen, you will need to fix it yourself within Xcode.

**Installation Instructions**

###Once I have a precompiled IPA, I will update the instructions here.

1. Compile and install the app using Xcode. This will require using macOS.
2. Trust the app on your device,
3. Enjoy!
